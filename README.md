# Emotes
Emotes from the TastyPlug extension.

## Building
You need node.js and npm.
After you `npm install` in the project directory, run `npm run build`.
You should now have the project built in the `public/` folder.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/catsaretasty/emotes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/catsaretasty/emotes)

## Adding emotes
Put files in the `emotes/` folder in whatever subdirectory you want.
The filename would be `butts.png` if I wanted to make an emote called butts.

You should only have a-z, 0-9, \_, or - in the filename (uppercase is fine).

That means that if I want to make a `butts!` emote, I would name the file something like `butts_bang.png`
and create a file called `butts_bang.png.json` in the same directory with the properly formatted json.
The correctly formatted json looks like below:

```json
{
  "name": "butts!",
  "mainCategory": "buttstuff",
  "subCategories": [
    "rectum",
    "Hershey Highway",
    "Moneymaker",
    "mud flaps"
  ]
}
```
Note that none of these are required, you are able to have all of them, some of them, one of them, or none
(none means no file, or a file with an empty `{}` - but you're not a monster, are you?).

Otherwise, if you are only using the characters I listed earlier,
the emote name will be automatically pulled from the filename.

Currently files (emotes) with the same name will overwrite each other, so don't do that until I get un-lazy.
Also, other crap probably isn't working or is broken, but I'm lazy.  Will come back to it later maybe?

## Guidelines for Emotes

 - Try to keep images at 35px height and 75px width maximum each.
 - No, we cannot add your "artist logo" emote, or "your face" emote, try to add emotes that people would like and use as much as you would.
 - Avoid submitting low quality emotes, such as squared (exceptions allowed), bad transparency applied (like having white dots/border around the image), or if the emote is not clear enough (too small to be seen or understood).
 - When naming your emote, please check for the same existing name in other sources (twitch, rcs), while Tastyplug can still overlap them, its best to not inutilize an emote someone else could use.

## Format
There are 3 formats created when running the build.

The first is the `emotes.json` file:
```json
{
  "emotes": {
    "AngryMittens":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/AngryMittens.png",
    "Basssss":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/Basssss.png",
    "BoopBlock":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/BoopBlock.png",
    ...
  }
}
```

The second is the `emotes-full.json` file:
```json
{
  "emotes": {
    "AngryMittens": {
      "url":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/AngryMittens.png",
      "height":35,
      "width":36
    },
    "Basssss": {
      "url":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/Basssss.png",
      "height":35,
      "width":36
    },
    "BoopBlock": {
      "url":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/BoopBlock.png",
      "height":35,
      "width":35
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

The last is the `emotes-data.json` file:
```json
[
  {
    "name":"AngryMittens",
    "url":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/AngryMittens.png",
    "height":35,
    "width":36
  },
  {
    "name":"Basssss",
    "url":"https://catsaretasty.github.io/emotes/emotes/cats/Basssss.png",
    "height":35,
    "width":36
  },
  ...
]
```
